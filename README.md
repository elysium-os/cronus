ElysiumOS is a 64bit hobby operating system designed mainly by me (@WuX). Elysium currently only supports the x86_64 architecture, although support for Aarch64 is planned.

## Development
The [.vscode](./.vscode) directory contains an example configuration for vscode. Infer setup from this configuration for other IDE's. For initial setup, execute `tools/gen_kernel_headers.sh` generate the necessary headers.
